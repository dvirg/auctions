"""
A utility for performing simulation experiments on auction mechanisms.
The experiment is similar to the one described by McAfee (1992), Table I (page 448).
In each experiment, we measure the actual vs. the optimal gain-from-trade.

The results are printed to a CSV file. The columns are:

* recipe - (1,1) for McAfee; can be any vector of ones, e.g. (1,1,1), for our trade-reduction mechanism, or any vector of positive integers for our ascending-auction mechanism.
* num_of_agents - n = total number of potential procurement-sets (e.g. if n=100 and recipe=[1,2] then there are 100 buyers and 200 sellers).
* mean_optimal_count - k = number of deals in the optimal trade, averaged over all iterations.
                       Note that k <= n. E.g., there may be 100 buyers and 100 sellers, but only 50 procurement-sets with positive GFT, so k=50.
* mean_auction_count - number of deals done by our auction,  averaged over all iterations.
                       Theoretically, since at most one deal is removed, it should be  either k or k-1.
* count_ratio  = mean_auction_count / mean_optimal_count  * 100%.
* mean_optimal_gft - OPT = gain-from-trade in the optimal trade, 	averaged over all iterations.
* mean_auction_gft - GFT = gain-from-trade in the auction, averaged over all iterations.
* gft_ratio  = mean_auction_gft / mean_optimal_gft * 100%.
              Theoretically it should be at least 1 - 1/k.
              In the results, it is usually higher.
* stock_names = list of stock names that the experiment run on them.
